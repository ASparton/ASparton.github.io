                        <p>Made in a 3-person team with the theme: "Stronger Together", Divided Soul is a 2D puzzle game in cooperation.
                           You play two split souls on the same keyboard which have to merge together to become complete (and complete the level!).
                           We created 2 levels and are now looking to push forward this one-night idea.

                        <p>Retro 1010! is a Tetris-like game, inspired by the quite famous "1010!".
                           You need to place pieces of different sizes and shapes on a 10 by 10 board,
                           and try to always have enough places to do so.
                           You earn points when placing a piece, or supressing a line by filling up an entire row or column.
                           I did this game during my free time in high school and spent a good amount of time developing alone all parts of the game,
                           including the sound system and the texture design.</p>

                        <p>Towa is a board game developed during my classes which oppose two players on a board with a predefined number of rounds.
                           Each round, the player has multiple actions available which can increase or decrease the number of pieces.
                           The player's goal is, at the end of the predefined number of rounds, to have more pieces than their oponent.
